I am currently a CNRS researcher at [LAPLACE](http://www.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/), in the [CODIASE](http://www.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/Presentation-1444) group. 

# Research

My research interests are control, system theory, model order reduction and system identification. In particular, I aim at proposing data-driven strategies for modelling, control and analysis of systems, with a specific focus on energy systems.

# Short bio

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at LTH (Lund, Sweden) in the Department of Automatic Control, where I worked on the modelling and control of district heating and cooling networks. Before that, I was a PhD student at ONERA, Toulouse (France), from 2016 to 2019. My work consisted in proposing a new data-driven control design technique in the frequency-domain. I received my PhD in October 2019 from ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France. I obtained my engineering degree from Ecole Centrale de Lyon in 2016 after a year as an exchange student in UNICAMP (Brazil) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer science (FEEC).
