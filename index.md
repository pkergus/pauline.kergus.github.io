## Pauline Kergus

I am currently a CNRS researcher at LAPLACE, in the CODIASE GROUP, where I work on the modeling, control and analysis of energy systems.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at LTH (Lund, Sweden) in the Department of Automatic Control, where I worked on the modelling and control of district heating and cooling networks with Anders Rantzer through his ERC project Scalable Control of Interconnected Systems.

Before that, I was a PhD student at ONERA, Toulouse (France), from 2016 to 2019. My work consisted in proposing a new data-driven control design technique in the frequency-domain. I received my PhD in October 2019 from ISAE-SUPAERO, Toulouse, France. 

I obtained my engineering degree from Ecole Centrale de Lyon in 2016 after a year as an exchange student in UNICAMP (Brazil) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer science (FEEC).

My research interests are control, system theory, model order reduction and system identification. In particular, I aim at proposing data-driven strategies for modelling, control and analysis of systems.
